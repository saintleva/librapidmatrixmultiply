# librapidmatrixmultiply
C++ generic library for rapid multiplication of matrices. It implements recursive Strassen algorithm, but throws-back to traditional (by definition) algorithm for optimization. Rested on boost::numeric::ublas library for linear algebra. Extensively uses templates for generalization and decomposition on strategies of algorithm implementation.
